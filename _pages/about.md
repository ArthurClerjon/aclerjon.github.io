<h1 style="display:none;">Arthur Clerjon â€“ Researcher in Energy Systems Modeling, Decarbonation of power systems</h1>


Welome to my peronal website!

<div style="background-color: #fff3cd; color: #856404; border: 2px solid #ffeeba; padding: 10px 20px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 5px; font-weight: bold; text-align: center; box-shadow: 0 2px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">

I am a **permanent research scientist** at [**CEA Grenoble**](https://www.cea.fr/english/Pages/energy/energy.aspx), working at the intersection of **engineering**, **economics**, and **environmental science**. My research focuses on assessing the **feasibility**, **carbon impact**, and **economic performance** of **low-carbon energy systems**.

With a background in **physics** and a **PhD in energy systems modeling**, I specialize in analyzing **system flexibility**â€”how **power grids** can remain balanced as we scale up **intermittent renewables** and **electrify** key sectors such as **heating** and **transport**.

I am currently developing **integrated approaches** to energy planning as part of the [**EQUALS â€“ Global Equitable Allocation of Renewable Energy Sources**](/projects/equals) project, which explores how to **optimaly** deploy low-carbon technologies across the world based on **climate**, **energy uses** and **territorial specificities**.

My goal is to understand and model **trade-offs** between **technologies**, **resource availability**, and **local needs**, in order to help design **realistic** and **context-sensitive energy transitions**.

I am also committed to **knowledge sharing**â€”through [**teaching**](https://www.ense3.grenoble-inp.fr/), **research supervision**, and **public engagement**â€”and to advancing **open science** practices.

## What I work on

- Reducing emissions from **[heating systems](/projects/heat-decarbonization)** (~30% of national GHG emissions)  
- Supporting the electrification of **[road transport](/projects/transport-decarbonization)** (~15%)  
- Modeling the **[flexibility needs of electric power systems](/projects/energy-system-flexibility)**

I am particularly eager to carry out **interdisciplinary research** to understand how **technical solutions** can be effectively and **equitably deployed** in the real world. This approach is at the heart of my current project: **[EQUALS â€“ Global Equitable Allocation of Renewable Energy Sources](/equals)**.
