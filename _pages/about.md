<h1 style="display:none;">Arthur Clerjon – Researcher in Energy Systems Modeling, Climate Policy, Decarbonation in France</h1>

I am a permanent researcher at the [CEA](https://www.cea.fr/) in Grenoble, France, working on the design and evaluation of energy systems compatible with climate neutrality targets.

My work lies at the intersection of engineering, economics, and environmental science. It focuses on the **feasibility**, **carbon impact**, and **economic performance** of low-carbon energy systems, particularly in the context of **France's climate goals**.

With a background in physics and a PhD in energy systems modeling, I specialize in the analysis of **system flexibility**—how power grids can stay balanced as we shift toward **intermittent renewable sources** and electrify sectors like **heating** and **transport**.

### What I work on

- Reducing emissions from **heating systems** (~30% of national GHG emissions)  
- Supporting the electrification of **road transport** (~15%)  
- Modeling the flexibility needs of **electric power systems**  
- Exploring trade-offs between **efficiency**, **cost**, and **decarbonation pathways**  

This website presents my [research projects](/projects/), [publications](/publications/), and accessible summaries of recent work.
