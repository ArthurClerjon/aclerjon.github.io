### This website is under construction.

---

I am a permanent researcher at the [CEA](https://www.cea.fr/) in Grenoble, France, working on designing energy systems that can meet ambitious climate goals. My research aims at understanding how technological decisions affect the **technical feasibility**, **environmental impacts** and **economic performance** of energy systems.

With a background in physics and engineering and a PhD in energy system modeling, I specialize in the **flexibility of power systems** ([more details here](https://nuage.gresille.org/index.php/s/kwC8GiJJn3FbmJG)). In other words, I study how electricity supply and demand can stay balanced despite the growing use of **intermittent renewable energies** and increasing electrification of key sectors such as **transport** and **heating**.

My recent work has particularly addressed two major sources of greenhouse gases in France: **heat production** (~30% of emissions) and **road transport** (~15%).

This website hosts my publications and ongoing projects, along with broader reflections and outreach activities aimed at making my research **accessible and useful** beyond academic circles.

I am always enthusiastic about discussing my workâ€”feel free to contact me at **arthur.clerjon 'at' cea.fr**.
