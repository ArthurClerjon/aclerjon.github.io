### This website is under construction.

I am a researcher specializing in energy system modeling and the decarbonization of energy systems.

I am a permanent researcher at CEA, Grenoble.

My work focuses on the integration of variable renewable energy sources, the flexibility needs of power systems, and the socio-economic dimensions of climate mitigation. I hold a PhD in energy economics and contribute to interdisciplinary projects that combine quantitative modeling with policy-relevant analysis.
