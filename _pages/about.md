<h1 style="display:none;">Arthur Clerjon â€“ Researcher in Energy Systems Modeling, Decarbonation of power systems</h1>


Welome to my peronal website!

<div style="background-color: #fff3cd; color: #856404; border: 2px solid #ffeeba; padding: 10px 20px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 5px; font-weight: bold; text-align: center; box-shadow: 0 2px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">

I am a **permanent research scientist** at [**CEA Grenoble**](https://www.cea.fr/english/Pages/energy/energy.aspx), working on energy systems modelling.


I am particularly focusing on the analysys of  electricity **system flexibility**â€”how **power grids** can remain balanced as we scale up **intermittent renewables** and **electrify** key sectors such as **heating** and **transport**.

I am currently developing **integrated approaches** to energy planning as part of the [**EQUALS â€“ Global Equitable Allocation of Renewable Energy Sources**](/projects/equals) project, which explores how to **optimaly** deploy low-carbon technologies across the world based on **climate**, **energy uses** and **territorial specificities**.

One of my research ambition is to understand and model trade-offs between **technologies**, **resource availability**, and **local needs**, in order to help design **realistic** energy transition pathways.

I am also committed to knowledge sharingâ€”through [teaching](/teaching), research supervision, and public engagement.

## What I work on

You can find here some examples of my research projects:

- Modeling the **[flexibility needs of electric power systems](/projects/energy-system-flexibility)**
- Reducing emissions from **[heating systems](/projects/heat-decarbonization)** (~30% of national GHG emissions)  
- Supporting the electrification of **[road transport](/projects/transport-decarbonization)** (~15%)  


I strongly believe that to face the challenges of energy transition and economy decarbonation while staying within the planetary boundaries and societal plancher, it is necessary to bridge scientific fields, meeting technical optimums, territorial specificities, economical and political contexts.
For this reason, I initiated an **interdisciplinary research** project **[EQUALS â€“ Global Equitable Allocation of Renewable Energy Sources](/projects/equals)**, funded by the French research agency (ANR).

This website presents my [**research projects**](/projects/), [**publications**](/publications/), and **accessible summaries** of recent work.

I am always very happy to discuss my research projects, feel free to reach out at arthur.clerjon (at) cea.fr!
