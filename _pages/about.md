### This website is under construction.

---

I am a permanent researcher at the [CEA](https://www.cea.fr/) in Grenoble, France. My work focuses on how to design and adapt energy systems to support climate goals, with particular attention to **technical**, **economic**, and **environmental** constraints.

With a background in physics and engineering, and a PhD in energy system modeling, I study the impacts of technological choices—such as **renewable energy**, **energy storage**, or **electrification**—on the structure and performance of energy systems, from national to international scales.

**Overall, my focus is the flexibility of power systems** ([see my teaching courses in the dedicated section](https://nuage.gresille.org/index.php/s/kwC8GiJJn3FbmJG)), that is to say how to balance **electricity supply and demand** in a changing world, with an increasing share of **intermittent renewables** and new energy uses—such as **electric vehicles** and **electric heating systems**.

My research has focused in particular on two key sectors: **heat production** (which accounts for around **30%** of greenhouse gas emissions in France) and **road transport** (around **15%**).

This website presents my publications, current projects, and, over time, broader reflections and outreach materials. I aim to make research results **accessible and useful** beyond academic circles.

I am always enthusiastic to discuss these topics—feel free to reach out at **arthur.clerjon 'at' cea.fr**.
