<h1 style="display:none;">Arthur Clerjon – Researcher in Energy Systems, Climate, Decarbonation</h1>

### 🔧 This website is under construction.

---

I am a permanent researcher at the [CEA](https://www.cea.fr/) in Grenoble, France, working on the design of energy systems aligned with climate neutrality objectives. My research focuses on the **technical feasibility**, **environmental impacts**, and **economic performance** of energy transitions.

With a background in physics and engineering, and a PhD in energy systems modeling, I specialize in **flexibility analysis** — understanding how power systems can remain stable despite intermittent **renewable energy** and growing electricity demand from **mobility** and **heating**.

### 🔬 My work in a nutshell

- 🏠 Decarbonizing **heating** (~30% of French GHG emissions)
- 🚗 Decarbonizing **transport** (~15%)
- ⚡ Modeling the flexibility needs of electric systems
- 📈 Analyzing trade-offs between efficiency, cost, and climate goals

This website hosts my latest [projects](/projects/), [publications](/publications/), and accessible summaries of my ongoing work.
