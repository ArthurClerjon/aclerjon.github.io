## Project Summary

The **EQUALS** project (**Equitable Allocation of Low-carbon Electricity Sources in a Changing and Resource-limited World**) addresses a central challenge of the global energy transition: how to deploy low-carbon electricity systems that are technically robust, environmentally sustainable, and socially equitable across regions. The project is funded by the ANR JCJC (young researcher) program (2025‚Äì2029) and coordinated by Arthur Clerjon.


**This project aims to help think the development of intermittent renewable energy sources and low-carbon sources within the planetary boundaries**. The primary goal is to explore the global distribution of photovoltaic (PV) and wind power and their complementarity with nuclear and hydropower to minimize the reliance on fossil fuels. Analyses of this deployment will be conducted under environmental constraints, mainly raw materials availability. It will lead to explore the links between climate, energy use and the development of electricity generation infrastructures. To illustrate this idea, in California, PV production perfectly matches summer air-conditioning demand, making its development more profitable than in France, where the constraint currently comes from winter heating needs, when PV production is at its minimum. The resources used to produce PV panels will not provide equivalent energy service in either countries. To achieve these analyses, we will develop a model of the power system that sizes production and flexibility capacities, in every country or region of the world. 

**EQUALS seeks to:**
- Identify where and how low-carbon electricity supply can meet regional electricity demand.
- Integrate constraints from planetary boundaries, material availability, and environmental compatibility.
- Design deployment pathways that respect regional equity and global sustainability.

## An Interdisciplinary Team

The EQUALS project builds on initial research carried out by **Arthur Clerjon** during his [PhD thesis](https://hal.science/tel-03230033/). His work is now being extended at the global scale through the doctoral research of **[Justine Duval](https://theses.fr/s399297)**, who is developing the project‚Äôs first proof of concept.

To explore the link between energy systems and resource availability, the project involves the ISTerre group led by [**Olivier Vidal**](https://www.isterre.fr/annuaire/pages-web-du-personnel/olivier-vidal/), with the support of [**Hugo Le Boulzec**](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hugo-Le-Boulzec-2).

To bridge energy geography and technical modeling, [**Emmanuelle Santoire**](https://latts.fr/membres/santoireemmanuelle/) (LATTS, CNRS) will contribute expertise in territorial planning and regulation. She will work with the support of a master‚Äôs intern (_position open_) to integrate spatial constraints and local governance into the global energy modeling framework.

To provide a prospective dimension and assess the influence of future climate conditions on energy supply and demand, **Fran√ßois-Marie Br√©on** (CEA-LSCE) will contribute his expertise in climate science and environmental modeling.

Finally, [**Fabien Perdu**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabien-perdu-7325a41a5/) and [**Pimprenelle Parmentier**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pimprenelle-parmentier-6b0373131/) (CEA), already co-supervising Justine Duval‚Äôs PhD, will contribute to the methodological and technical development of the energy system model.


## Preliminary results

EQUALS built on previous researches and embed the ongoing PhD thesis of Justine SDuval. To illustrate the overall mindset of this work, we present here prior results extracted from the folowing conference paper presented at the 2025 ECOS international conference: [Duval et al. (2025) ‚Äì ECOS 2025 Conference Paper](https://cea.hal.science/cea-05141769)

This figure (a) shows optimal wind/PV power mixes that enable to minimize the requirement to dispatchable power plants. These strategies consider regional demand and climate compatibility.

Figure b shows the results distribution as a function  of the country's lattitude.
