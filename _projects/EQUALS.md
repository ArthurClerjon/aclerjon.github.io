  The project acronym <strong>EQUALS</strong> stands for 
 <em>‚ÄúEQUItable Allocation of Low-carbon Electricity Sources in a Changing and Resource-limited World.‚Äù</em> Another possible name could have been <em>‚ÄúOptimal Allocation of Low-carbon Electricity Sources [‚Ä¶]‚Äù</em>, 
  reflecting the project‚Äôs dual ambition:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    To optimize the global allocation of low-carbon electricity sources in a resource-constrained world.
  </li>
  <li>
    To investigate how universal access to low-carbon electricity can be achieved in an equitable way‚Äîensuring a decent standard of living while staying within planetary boundaries.

## Project Summary

**EQUALS** addresses a key question in the global energy transition: how can we deploy low-carbon electricity systems that are technically viable, environmentally sustainable, and socially equitable across regions?

Funded by the ANR JCJC (young researchers) program and coordinated by **Arthur Clerjon**, the project seeks to support the global development of renewable and low-carbon electricity within the limits of resource availability and planetary boundaries.

The core objective is to explore the optimal global distribution of photovoltaic (PV), wind, nuclear, and hydropower capacities‚Äîminimizing reliance on fossil fuels. This will involve assessing deployment feasibility under various environmental constraints, particularly the availability of critical raw materials.

To illustrate: in California, solar production aligns well with summer air-conditioning demand, making PV highly effective. In contrast, France faces winter peaks for heating, when solar output is lowest. A PV panel will not deliver the same energy service in both places‚Äîraising questions of how and where best to invest resources globally.

To carry out these analyses, EQUALS will develop a global energy system model that sizes both production and flexibility capacities at the country and regional levels.

Overall, **EQUALS seeks to:**

- Identify where and how low-carbon electricity can meet local demand.
- Integrate constraints from planetary boundaries, material availability, and environmental compatibility.
- Design deployment strategies that respect both regional equity and global sustainability.

## An Interdisciplinary Team

The EQUALS project builds on research by **Arthur Clerjon** during his [PhD thesis](https://hal.science/tel-03230033/). His work continues globally through the PhD research of **[Justine Duval](https://theses.fr/s399297)**, who is developing the project‚Äôs first proof of concept.

To explore the connection between energy and resources, the project collaborates with the **ISTerre** group led by [**Olivier Vidal**](https://www.isterre.fr/annuaire/pages-web-du-personnel/olivier-vidal/), with support from [**Hugo Le Boulzec**](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hugo-Le-Boulzec-2).

To bridge energy modeling with spatial and regulatory constraints, [**Emmanuelle Santoire**](https://latts.fr/membres/santoireemmanuelle/) (LATTS, CNRS) will lead efforts in geography and territorial planning. She will be joined by a master's intern (_position open_).

To integrate a climate perspective, **Fran√ßois-Marie Br√©on** (CEA-LSCE) will bring expertise in climate science in order to assess and quantify influence of future climates on long-term energy demand and intermittent supply.

Finally, [**Fabien Perdu**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabien-perdu-7325a41a5/) and [**Pimprenelle Parmentier**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pimprenelle-parmentier-6b0373131/) (CEA), co-supervisors of Justine Duval‚Äôs PhD, will support the methodological and technical development of the global energy model.

## Preliminary Results

EQUALS builds on previous research and incorporates the ongoing PhD work of Justine Duval. Below is an illustration of the project's approach, from the 2025 ECOS International Conference:

Overall, this figure shows an optimal mixes of PV and wind that would minimize dispatchable power sources. To go further, here a some of the folowing steps:

- Increasing model complexity: to include interconnexions, existing low-carbon dispatchable sources (hydro and nuclear)
- Adding regional and fglobal environmental  constraints, such as greenhouse gas budgets, land availability, etc. to assess how these constraints impact balances between power sources in each region.
- Building prospective energy demand and supplys time-series, accounting for future climates and energy demand paterns.
- etc.
