## Project Summary

The **EQUALS** project ("Equitable Allocation of Low-carbon Electricity Sources in a Changing and Resource-limited World") addresses a central challenge of the global energy transition: how to deploy renewable electricity systems that are technically robust, environmentally sustainable, and socially equitable across regions. The project is funded by the ANR JCJC program (2025–2029) and coordinated by Arthur Clerjon (CEA I-Tésé).

The transition away from fossil-based energy systems cannot rely solely on replicating dispatchable capacity with solar or wind. These variable renewable energy sources (VRES) are inherently dependent on local climatic conditions and vary significantly in availability and efficiency across regions and seasons. In parallel, electricity demand patterns vary widely depending on economic structure, lifestyle, and climatic constraints. 

**EQUALS seeks to:**
- Identify where and how low-carbon electricity supply can meet regional electricity demand.
- Integrate constraints from planetary boundaries, material availability, and environmental compatibility.
- Design deployment pathways that respect regional equity and global sustainability.

The project combines energy modeling, climate analysis, geospatial constraints, and interdisciplinary methods to inform decision-making under global constraints.

## Scientific Foundations

EQUALS builds directly on Arthur Clerjon’s doctoral and postdoctoral work on renewable integration and storage optimization:

- [@clerjon_phd_2021] — analysis of electricity system response to large-scale VRES integration in France.
- [@clerjon_eroi_2019] — time-scale decomposition of VRES variability and comparative ESOI of storage technologies.
- [@clerjon_matching_2022] — linear optimization of storage and curtailment strategies across fluctuating demand signals.
- [@duval:cea-05141769] — doctoral research quantifying optimal wind/PV deployment strategies considering regional demand and climate compatibility.

These works establish the conceptual and methodological core of EQUALS. Further contributions are expected through ongoing collaborations and doctoral supervision.

## Project Contributors

The project is led by Arthur Clerjon (CEA I-Tésé), with contributions from Olivier Vidal (ISTerre, CNRS), Emmanuelle Santoire (LATTS, CNRS), François-Marie Bréon (CEA LSCE), Fabien Perdu and Pimprenelle Parmentier (CEA Liten), and PhD candidate Justine Duval.

## Ongoing Research Roles

- PhD: Justine Duval (2024–2027, CEA Liten)
- Postdoctoral researcher (18 months, recruitment ongoing)
- New PhD start in 2025 (CEA/ISTerre)
- Master's internship in geography (LATTS, 2025)
- Short internship for platform/interface prototyping

## First Results

Early simulations show strong spatial and seasonal variations in the viability of solar vs. wind to meet electricity demand, depending on the climatic and socioeconomic profile of each region.
