  abstract     = {The rising share of Variable Renewable Energy Sources (VRES) in the electricity generation mix leads to new challenges for the whole energy system. It especially raises technological issues to handle variability and to match electricity load with supply at all times. This study introduces a new methodology to quantify the relevance of different electricity storage technologies, based on a time scale analysis. It additionally provides an understanding of how electricity storages work in combination to handle variable load and intermittent generation. First, we set up a simple model of variable production, fluctuating over a single time-scale. This analysis provides figures of merit for electricity storage and curtailment. Second, we simulate the collaboration and competition behavior of various storages with a dual time-scale signal. Then, results are compared with the optimization of an energy system with real variable electricity supply and consumption time-series. We eventually highlight the trade-off mechanisms between the storage efficiency and its investment cost.},

  abstract     = {A high penetration of variable renewable energy sources in an electricity generation mix leads to strong constraints on the whole system to ensure a continuous balance between electricity production and consumption. We have developed a new numerical methodology to quantify the relevance of several electricity storage devices that would provide the required flexibility. First of all, through a signal analysis (wavelet decomposition) of photovoltaic power (PV), wind power and load time series, we study and characterize the intermittency at different time scales. Then, each storage technology is evaluated for each time scale from an energy return on investment (EROI) standpoint. They are also compared with the possibility of curtailing excess electricity instead of storing it. The relevance of a given technology especially depends on its efficiency and embodied energy. For instance, we show that batteries are not appropriate for long term storage because of their high embodied energy. However, they are a good choice for short term applications with high cycle requirements because of their efficiency. We characterize the relevance of storage devices, their sensitivity to the production mix and to technological characteristics. We point out that satisfying the energy demand of exceptional events only with storage devices requires an over-sizing of the whole system. It underlines the complementarity of energy storage with dispatchable electricity sources. We eventually show that seasonal electricity storage is particularly difficult to ensure with a good energy return on investment.},
