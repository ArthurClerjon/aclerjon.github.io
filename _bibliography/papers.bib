	abstract = {France aims to massively develop intermittent renewable energies - wind and photovoltaic
- while reducing the share of dispatchable sources, in this case, nuclear power This
paradigm shift implies rethinking the management of energy systems Indeed, renewables'
variable nature generates a need for flexibility on different time-scales, from day
to year As dispatchable means' flexibility can no longer be relied on, this thesis
questions the potential of other means to meet this need: electricity storage, oversized
production and heating networksFaced with the need for a systemic approach, we developed
simple models to enhance the understanding of the interdependencies between production
and storage The optimized indicators are economic (), but also environmental: embodied
energy and greenhouse gas emissions over the entire life cycle The performances of
the systems considered are those of today and their development is limited by resource
and space availability Without going into the precise details of how each technology
works, this physical approach points out optimal operation areas for the different
technologies and the difficult cases for which solutions are still lackingFirst, the
need for flexibility generated for different intermittency penetration rates is quantified
for several time scales It enables us to compare the potential of different electricity
storage technologies - at each of these scales - to bring production and consumption
in phase The results show that long time-scales - typically seasonal storage - require
the largest investments for low profitability The competition mechanisms between several
storages and over sizing are then analyzed It shows how the optimum solutions use
complementary flexibility means The study then addresses the potential of coupling
between the electrical grid and the heating grid as a means of flexibility, particularly
for the management of long-term needsThis thesis work focuses on the French scale,
although the methodology is applicable elsewhere (author)},

	annote = {[fr] La France affiche une volonte de developper massivement les energies renouvelables intermittentes - eolien et photovoltaique - tout en diminuant la part des sources pilotables, ici le nucleaire. Ce changement de paradigme implique de repenser la gestion des systemes energetiques. En effet, l'intermittence des renouvelables genere un besoin de flexibilite a differentes echelles de temps, de la journee a l'annee. Ne pouvant plus se reposer sur la flexibilite des moyens pilotables, cette these questionne le potentiel d'autres moyens pour y repondre: stockage d'electricite, surdimensionnement de la production et reseaux de chaleur. Face a la necessite d'une approche systeme, des modeles simples ont ete developpes pour affiner la comprehension des interdependances entre production et stockages. Les indicateurs optimises sont economiques (Euros) mais aussi environnementaux: energie grise et emission de gaz a effet de serre sur l'ensemble du cycle de vie. Les performances des systemes consideres sont celles d'aujourd'hui et leur developpement est limite par les ressources et l'espace disponibles. Sans rentrer dans le detail precis du fonctionnement de chaque technologie, cette approche physique donne les domaines de fonctionnement optimaux des differentes technologies, et les cas difficiles pour lesquels les solutions manquent encore. Dans un premier temps, le besoin en flexibilite genere pour differents taux de penetration de l'intermittence est quantifie pour plusieurs echelles de temps. Cela permet de comparer le potentiel de differentes technologies de stockage d'electricite a chacune de ces echelles pour mettre en phase production et consommation. Les resultats montrent que les temps longs - typiquement le stockage saisonnier - sont ceux qui demandent les plus gros investissements pour une faible rentabilite. Ensuite, les mecanismes de competition entre plusieurs stockages et le surdimensionnement sont analyses pour montrer dans quel cas les optimums utilisent des solutions complementaires. L'etude aborde alors le potentiel du couplage entre le reseau electrique et le reseau de chaleur comme moyen de flexibilite, notamment pour la gestion des besoins longs termes. Ce travail de these se focalise a l'echelle Francaise, bien que la methodologie soit applicable ailleurs},

	title = {Impact of a possible large scale development of {SMRs} on natural uranium consumption and deployment of nuclear power worldwide},
	url = {https://hal.science/hal-03988111},
	abstract = {Small modular reactors (SMRs) are on the rise, especially because of their expected modularity, shorter construction time, and low capital costs compared to large Generation III nuclear reactors; they are also likely to be more uranium intensive. In such case, we studied the impact of SMR development on uranium resources and its effect on fast reactor deployment using GRUS, a system dynamic-based numerical tool. Based on nuclear energy demand scenarios up to the year 2150, we show the evolution of the nuclear fleet by reactor type, along with the associated uranium consumption. In all our scenarios and even without SMRs, the global development of nuclear energy in 2150 already exceeds conventional uranium resources. On top of it, in a nuclear fleet made of EPRs and FRs, SMRs could lead to an additional uranium requirement of about 25\%. Furthermore, the non-reprocessing of SMRs spent fuels would reduce plutonium stocks, what would impact the deployment of fast reactors and cause an additional demand of natural uranium of more than 10\%. Finally, the SMRs, by accelerating the use of uranium resources, increase its cost and bring forward the date of competitiveness of fast reactors from a few years to several decades. The results indicate that to ensure the sustainability of nuclear power with SMRs, a particular attention must be paid during the design phase of such modular reactors to uranium consumption and fuel reprocessing.},

	abstract = {In the energy transition context, district heating have great potential for generating low-carbon and cost-effective heat. They can also provide flexibility to the electrical system thanks to sector coupling solutions and thermal energy storage allowing, for instance, better integration of variable energy sources. Therefore, assessing the competitiveness of district heating would require a sector-coupled optimisation model with, as an input, the costs of the district heating infrastructure estimated throughout the entire territory at a high spatial resolution, gathered in ready-to-implement clusters. Based on the work from Persson and Werner, we present a methodology to map and cluster district heating network costs on an entire territory. It relies on easy-to-access geospatial key variables such as heat demand, building density and winter temperatures. As a case study, we applied it to France and designed two clustering approaches to gather the infrastructure costs: competitiveness-based and territory typology-based – to satisfy different model architectures. We observe, for instance, a 51 TWh annual heat supply potential for district heating in French urban areas for a total investment of 10 b€. With this comprehensive and replicable methodology, we aim to lead the way for a new and broader competitiveness assessment of district heating in sector-coupled models.},

	abstract = {One main strategy for a sustainable low-carbon future relies on the decarbonisation of heat – thanks to its electrification and the reinforcement of sector coupling.Heat-and-electricity energy models are used to determine specifically the best coupling strategy and provide, in fine, recommendations to the decision-makers.Such coupled models can aggregate the heat demand (i.e. every heating solution can address any part of the total demand at any time) or disaggregate it (i.e. one given heat demand per technology). Whether or not this demand should be disaggregated – and at what level – is unclear as different studies apply different disaggregation strategies.This methodological study is dedicated to settling how the heat sector should be modelled – from a (dis)aggregation perspective. It relies on a heat-and-electricity optimisation toy model at the national scale made of an individual heating mix and a district heating and is used to assess how and to what extent different disaggregation strategies affect the modelled system.First, this study brings awareness about how heat demand disaggregation ensures an accurate cost calculation of the thermal system. We show that the disaggregation can be applied thanks to added optimisation constraints. We demonstrate that the heat demand disaggregation influences the behaviour and sizing of the optimised model. This study concludes with our recommendation to disaggregate the heat demand between heating mixes and between technologies in heat-and-electricity models.},

	abstract = {The rising share of Variable Renewable Energy Sources (VRES) in the electricity generation mix leads to new challenges for the whole energy system. It especially raises technological issues to handle variability and to match electricity load with supply at all times. This study introduces a new methodology to quantify the relevance of different electricity storage technologies, based on a time scale analysis. It additionally provides an understanding of how electricity storages work in combination to handle variable load and intermittent generation. First, we set up a simple model of variable production, fluctuating over a single time-scale. This analysis provides figures of merit for electricity storage and curtailment. Second, we simulate the collaboration and competition behavior of various storages with a dual time-scale signal. Then, results are compared with the optimization of an energy system with real variable electricity supply and consumption time-series. We eventually highlight the trade-off mechanisms between the storage efficiency and its investment cost.},

abstract  ="A high penetration of variable renewable energy sources in an electricity generation mix leads to strong constraints on the whole system to ensure a continuous balance between electricity production and consumption. We have developed a new numerical methodology to quantify the relevance of several electricity storage devices that would provide the required flexibility. First of all{,} through a signal analysis (wavelet decomposition) of photovoltaic power (PV){,} wind power and load time series{,} we study and characterize the intermittency at different time scales. Then{,} each storage technology is evaluated for each time scale from an energy return on investment (EROI) standpoint. They are also compared with the possibility of curtailing excess electricity instead of storing it. The relevance of a given technology especially depends on its efficiency and embodied energy. For instance{,} we show that batteries are not appropriate for long term storage because of their high embodied energy. However{,} they are a good choice for short term applications with high cycle requirements because of their efficiency. We characterize the relevance of storage devices{,} their sensitivity to the production mix and to technological characteristics. We point out that satisfying the energy demand of exceptional events only with storage devices requires an over-sizing of the whole system. It underlines the complementarity of energy storage with dispatchable electricity sources. We eventually show that seasonal electricity storage is particularly difficult to ensure with a good energy return on investment."}
